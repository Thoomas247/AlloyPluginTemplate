# AlloyPluginTemplate
This repository is a template for creating standalone Alloy Game Engine plugins.

# Getting Started
- Click on "Use this template" and create your own repository (you can also just download the files if you do not want to use git).
- Open the premake5.lua file located in the root directory and change the PLUGIN_NAME variable to the name of your plugin. Save the file.
- Execute the GENERATE script which applies to your environment.
- You will now see various new files, including a folder called plugin which contains 2 projects, one for your plugin, and one for testing.
- Create your plugin within the PLUGIN_NAME project, and create tests for it in the Test project.
